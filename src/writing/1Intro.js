          Esther began learning how to build the GPT tokenizer with Andrej
          Karpathy. As she was learning, she realized, "OMG! The content is
          AMAZING! But why is it so... inhuman?" (Youtube content greater than
          30min = inhuman). The video is a scary 2 hours. Most of the time,
          people donâ€™t even dare to start. Can we make the learning less scary
          and more fun? <br></br>hi, future Esther (or some other humans), let
          me teach you what is tokenization.
